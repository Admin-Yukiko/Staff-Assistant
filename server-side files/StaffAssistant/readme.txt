These are the files required by the Staff Assistant. I decided to collect them in a package rather than mix them in the "standard" command directories.

Many of these commands are copied from the "standard" commands that are included in various scriptsets and renamed with the prefix "sa_".

There are a few commands that were not copied into this package. Info and iteminfo are two examples. Staff Assistant calls those commands by their name without the "sa_" prefix. The main reason I have not yet moved them to the StaffAssistant package is due to their dependancy on other files (includes) within a server. I might add copies of them to this package at a later date. I'd need to add the dependant includes so that this would be a stand alone package.

For some of the commands I appropriated to this package I needed includes to handle gumps and such. So you will find those in this package as well.
